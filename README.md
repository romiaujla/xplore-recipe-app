# XPLORE RECIPE APP
## App Info
An asynchronous web app that allows a user to browse through recipes using the Edamam API, which has a database of 1.7+ million nutritionally analyzed recipes with detailed macro and micronutrient data, filter by calories, diets, and allergens. A user can get detailed nutritional information on any recipe. It also allows adding all ingredients of a recipe to the grocery list, or the user can just add their custom items by entering the item in the provided input field on the grocery list page.

## Disabled User Story
- As a disabled user, I would like to navigate thru the whole app, using either a keyboard or mouse
- As a disabled user, I would like the website to aria compatible so a screen reader can pick up what the user is interacting with and read it back to the user.
